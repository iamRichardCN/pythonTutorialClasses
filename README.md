# Webinar Python Code Repository Readme

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Python code used in the webinar classes I organized for beginners. This repository contains several Python scripts that were discussed during the webinars. In addition to providing the code, this readme file will also touch upon what I, as the tutor, learned from the experience.

## Code Overview
Here's a brief overview of the Python scripts included in this repository:

### 1. `app.py`
This script takes user input for name and age and calculates how many years the user is away from turning 50. It then provides a personalized message based on the user's age.

### 2. `cal2.py`
This script allows the user to input a list of expenditures and calculates the total, maximum, and minimum expenses.

### 3. `expensecal.py`
Similar to `cal2.py`, this script tracks expenditures and calculates the total, maximum, and minimum expenses. However, it uses a different approach.

### 4. `list.py`
This script generates a list of numbers and a list of their corresponding even multiples.

### 5. `multiplicationtable.py`
This script generates a multiplication table for a user-specified number.

### 6. `finaltrackerproject.py`
This script records daily expenses in a CSV file and provides a summary of expenses for the day.

## What I, as the Tutor, Learned
As the tutor for these beginner-level webinars, I gained valuable insights and experiences, even if it wasn't my first time teaching. Here are some assumptions about what I might have learned:

1. **Enhanced Teaching Skills:** Revisiting fundamental Python concepts improved my ability to explain complex ideas in a simple and understandable way. Teaching beginners often requires breaking down concepts effectively.

2. **Adaptive Teaching:** Depending on the participants' questions and difficulties, I adapted my teaching style and explanations during the webinars. This adaptability is crucial for effective teaching.

3. **Debugging and Problem-Solving:** Addressing issues or errors that participants encountered with the code sharpened my debugging and problem-solving skills.

4. **Feedback Integration:** If participants provided feedback, I incorporated it into subsequent sessions, enhancing the quality of my teaching materials and methods.

5. **Increased Patience:** Teaching beginners often involves patience and the ability to explain concepts multiple times. This experience further developed my patience as an educator.

6. **Empathy for Learners:** Understanding the challenges beginners face in grasping programming concepts led to greater empathy for those I teach. This empathy improved my ability to connect with my audience.

Remember, the process of teaching is a learning experience in itself, and each session can offer new lessons and insights. Continuously improving teaching skills is a vital aspect of being an effective educator.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a valuable resource for beginners who attended my webinars and anyone interested in learning Python. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your programming journey. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the scripts, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge and helping beginners take their first steps into the world of Python programming. My dedication to teaching is greatly appreciated!
